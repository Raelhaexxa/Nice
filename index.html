                            Hello Nice, I made this for you because I'm not that good in writing letters, and I wanna really wanna express how much I like you in my own ways
                            because if it wrote this in a letter, you won't be able to understand my penmanship(AHAHAAH), but anyways, I just want to let you know that I'll do my best to win your heart,
                            when you asked if you are worth the risk, my answer is yes, I really appreciate you giving a thought of what happened few weeks back and it makes me think my feelings matters, just so you know,
                            I appreciate you a lot, you are smart, cute and pretty as well and I hope you know that I really like you, and I want to be with you(maybe one day HAHHAAA), and I want to make you happy.
                            I don't have much to say really, but just so you know you are special to me :) hoping for more dates to come with you.
